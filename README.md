# restaurant-billing-system
A full fledged command line interface based restaurant billing system

## Introduction
This program be used in restaurants to calculate the bill of every table. 
Since we have used ArrayLists, the number of tables can be 10, 10000 or even more. 
Every table is an object of class Table stored in an ArrayList of objects. We have also used file handling to read the menu items, which can be changed as per the restaurants needs, and exception handling to catch the error which might occur if the file is not present in the system. It is made using OOP Principles.
